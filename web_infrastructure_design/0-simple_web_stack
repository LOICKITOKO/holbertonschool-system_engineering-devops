The user accesses the URL www.foobar.com, which triggers the static server (web server) to serve content such as HTML, images, videos, etc.

If dynamic data needs to be handled, the request proceeds to the app server for code logic, for example: Python, Java, etc.

If database access is required, the request continues to my database for querying, for example: storage, ID, etc.
